<!-- Author: Nigel Finley, July 2016. This is the second of two homework assignements in the UT Bootcamp assigned the first week of class (July 20th, 2016). It consists of
making a basic portfolio site to include (within the index page): 
1. A header with a nav bar
2. A section with a biography, the 'about me' section and a profile image
3. An aside container that contains 'connect with me' links
4. A 'sticky' footer: one that doesn't move when the content changes size

            <p> <img class="profile-pic" src="assets/images/ProfilePic.jpg" alt="Profile Image"> Hello, world!. My name is Nigel Finley. I am working towards being a full-stack developer through the UT Bootcamp classes here in Austin, Texas. I am an avid soccer player and fan and I play music in a few bands locally. I live in south Austin with my wife and white mini-schnauzer.
            </p>
            <p> I really enjoy hiking, biking, snowboarding and swiming, when it is not 150 degrees outside. Majored in Music Business and currently work at Mood Media, a 360 experience design company but am looking for new challenges, hence the interest in web development. </p>
