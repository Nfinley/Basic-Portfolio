<!-- Author: Nigel Finley, July 2016. This is the second of two homework assignements in the UT Bootcamp assigned the first week of class (July 20th, 2016). It consists of
making a basic portfolio site to include (within the index page): 
1. A header with a nav bar
2. A section with a biography, the 'about me' section and a profile image
3. An aside container that contains 'connect with me' links
4. A 'sticky' footer: one that doesn't move when the content changes size
